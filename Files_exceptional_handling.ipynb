        "    -The key difference between interpreted and compiled languages lies in how\n",
        "    they execute code:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Compiled Languages\n",
        "    .The entire code is translated into machine code before execution using a compiler.\n",
        "    .The result is a separate executable file that can run independently.\n",
        "    .Faster execution since translation happens once.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Interpreted Languages\n",
        "    .Code is executed line-by-line at runtime using an interpreter.\n",
        "    .No separate executable file is generated; the interpreter must be present.\n",
        "    .Slower execution since translation happens every time the code runs.\n",

        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "    -Exception handling in Python is a way to manage and respond to errors (exceptions) that occur during program execution, preventing crashes and allowing graceful error recovery.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "    -The finally block in Python is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is commonly used for cleanup operations, such as closing files, releasing resources, or disconnecting from a database.    \n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "    -Logging in Python is a built-in way to track events that occur while a program runs. It is commonly used for debugging, monitoring, and error tracking instead of using print() statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "    -The __del__ method in Python is a destructor, automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., garbage collected). It is used to clean up resources like closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting from databases.\n",

        "    -Exception handling in Python allows you to manage runtime errors gracefully, preventing program crashes. The basic steps involved are:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Use try Block to Enclose Risky Code\n",
        "       Place the code that may raise an exception inside a try block.\n",
        "    2. Catch Exceptions with except\n",
        "       Use except to handle specific or general exceptions.\n",
        "    3. Use else for Code That Runs If No Exception Occurs (Optional)\n",
        "       The else block executes if there are no exceptions in the try block.\n",
        "    4. Use finally for Cleanup (Optional)\n",
        "       The finally block always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "    -Python's garbage collection (GC) system automatically manages memory by reclaiming unused objects to free up space. It primarily relies on reference counting and cyclic garbage collection.\n",
